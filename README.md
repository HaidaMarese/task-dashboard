#  Reflection: Task Management Dashboard

## How I Implemented React and TypeScript Features

I structured the app with reusable components like `TaskList`, `TaskForm`, and `TaskFilter`. I used TypeScript interfaces to define `Task`, `TaskFormData`, and `FilterOptions`, ensuring type safety across the application. The component props and state were fully typed.

## Challenges and Solutions

- **Form Validation:** I had to ensure users couldn't submit empty titles. I used a controlled form with error messages.
- **Dark Mode:** I implemented a toggle that syncs with `localStorage` and updates Tailwind’s `dark` class dynamically.
- **State Management:** Managing task updates required immutability and careful use of `map()` and `filter()`.

## Component Composition and State

Each component focuses on a single task:
- `Dashboard` manages global state
- `TaskForm` is a controlled form with validation
- `TaskList` renders task items
- `TaskItem` handles toggle/delete actions
- `TaskFilter` controls filter/search inputs

I used `useState`, `useEffect`, and `props` to manage state and flow data between components. I also saved data in `localStorage` using a `useEffect()` watcher.

## Notes

The app meets all SBA criteria:
- Strong TypeScript typing
- Form control and validation
- Clean component structure
- Filtering, searching, sorting
- Persistent and responsive UI
